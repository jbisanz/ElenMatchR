# ElenMatchR v1.0dev

Comparative genomics of Coriobacteriia based on random forests. Please visit the [shinyapps instance](https://jbisanz.shinyapps.io/elenmatchr/) to use. For certain large kmer-based jobs, it may be necessary to run locally in which case clone this repository.

### To do:
The kmer_lookup.RDS file is just too large for upload (104Mb), until fixed, please contact jordan.bisanz@gmail.com for access.
